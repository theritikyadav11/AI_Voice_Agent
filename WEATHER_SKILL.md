# Weather Skill Implementation

## Overview

The Weather Skill has been successfully integrated into your FastAPI backend, allowing users to ask about weather conditions for any city. The system automatically detects weather-related queries and provides real-time weather information using the Open-Meteo API.

## Features

✅ **Automatic Weather Detection**: Detects when users ask about weather  
✅ **City Name Extraction**: Extracts city names from natural language queries  
✅ **Real-time Weather Data**: Fetches current weather from Open-Meteo API  
✅ **Natural Language Responses**: Formats weather data into conversational responses  
✅ **Dual Endpoint Support**: Works with both WebSocket streaming and HTTP chat endpoints  
✅ **Graceful Fallback**: Falls back to Gemini for non-weather queries  
✅ **Error Handling**: Provides friendly error messages for invalid cities or API failures  
✅ **TTS Integration**: Converts weather responses to speech using Murf

## How It Works

### 1. Query Detection

The system uses pattern matching and keyword detection to identify weather queries:

**Supported Patterns:**

- "What's the weather in [city]?"
- "How hot/cold is it in [city]?"
- "Weather in [city]"
- "Temperature in [city]"
- "Forecast for [city]"

**Weather Keywords:**

- weather, temperature, forecast, climate, hot, cold, sunny, rainy, snow, wind, humidity, degrees

### 2. City Name Extraction

Uses regex patterns to extract city names from user queries, with fallback logic for simple cases.

### 3. Weather Data Retrieval

1. **Geocoding**: Converts city name to coordinates using Open-Meteo Geocoding API
2. **Weather Fetching**: Gets current weather data using Open-Meteo Weather API
3. **Data Processing**: Extracts temperature, wind speed, weather description, and humidity

### 4. Response Formatting

Formats weather data into natural, conversational responses that maintain the agent's friendly persona.

## API Integration

### WebSocket Streaming (`/ws/audio/{session_id}`)

- Detects weather queries in real-time
- Streams weather responses immediately
- Converts to speech using Murf TTS
- Maintains conversation flow

### HTTP Chat (`/agent/chat/{session_id}`)

- Processes uploaded audio files
- Returns weather data in JSON format
- Includes both text response and audio URL
- Provides structured weather data for frontend use

## Response Format

### Success Response

```json
{
  "city": "Paris",
  "temperature": 23.4,
  "wind_speed": 11.2,
  "description": "Partly cloudy",
  "humidity": 65
}
```

### Error Response

```json
{
  "error": "Sorry, I couldn't find the city 'InvalidCity'. Could you check the spelling or try a different city?"
}
```

## Weather Descriptions

The system maps weather codes to human-readable descriptions:

- 0-3: Clear to overcast skies
- 45-48: Foggy conditions
- 51-67: Rain and freezing rain
- 71-77: Snow conditions
- 80-86: Rain and snow showers
- 95-99: Thunderstorms

## Error Handling

1. **City Not Found**: Returns friendly message asking user to check spelling
2. **Weather API Failure**: Falls back to Gemini with error message
3. **Network Issues**: Graceful degradation with appropriate error messages
4. **Invalid Coordinates**: Handles malformed location data

## Testing

Run the test script to verify functionality:

```bash
python test_weather.py
```

## Example Usage

### Voice Queries

- "What's the weather like in Paris?"
- "How hot is it in Tokyo?"
- "Tell me the temperature in London"
- "Weather forecast for New York"

### Expected Responses

- "Here's the weather in Paris: It's currently 23.4°C with partly cloudy. The wind is blowing at 11.2 km/h. Humidity is at 65%."

## Configuration

No additional configuration required. The Weather Skill uses:

- Open-Meteo Geocoding API (free, no API key needed)
- Open-Meteo Weather API (free, no API key needed)
- Existing Murf TTS integration for speech synthesis

## Performance

- **Response Time**: Typically 1-3 seconds for weather queries
- **Accuracy**: High accuracy for major cities worldwide
- **Fallback**: Seamless fallback to Gemini for non-weather queries
- **Caching**: No caching implemented (real-time data)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

- Weather forecasting (hourly/daily)
- Unit conversion (Celsius/Fahrenheit)
- Weather alerts and warnings
- Historical weather data
- Multiple city comparison
- Weather-based recommendations
