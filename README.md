## 📖 Introduction

The **AI Voice Agent** is designed to demonstrate the possibilities of voice-first AI applications.  
It listens to user speech, transcribes it in real time, processes it using Google Gemini for intelligent responses, and then delivers those responses back using high-quality text-to-speech synthesis via Murf AI.

This setup is ideal for building:

- AI assistants
- Customer service bots
- Interactive storytelling agents
- Educational voice tutors
